# Robot code 2022 - TX03 🤖

## Objective 📌

Our robot works with subsystems and mechanics that seek to meet the requirements of the FIRST 2022 championship challenges - Rapid React

### How does the game work?
Two competing alliances are invited to process cargo for transportation. Each alliance is assigned a cargo color (Red and Blue) to process by retrieving their assigned cargo and scoring it into the hub. Human players assist the cargo retrieval and scoring efforts from within their terminals. In the final moments of each match, alliance robots race to engage with their hangar to prepare for transport!
